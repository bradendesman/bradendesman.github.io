# SMART ePANTS
*This is an ongoing IARPA program that I work on through the <a href='https://rlpvlsi.ece.virginia.edu/'>Robust Low Power VLSI group.</a>*

### Project Goals
<p class="description"> The goal of this program is to design clothing with integrated audio, video, and geolocation sensor systems while ensuring that the garment is indistinguishable from regular textiles. <a href='https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/smart-epants' target="_blank">Visit the program's webpage </a> for more information about its goals and requirements.</p>

### Current Status
<ul>
    <li>We are developing a system model in Python to evaluate how different architectures and topologies affect the power and performance of the system</li>
    <li>Our goal is to show partner institutions how different chip specifications impact the functionality and feasability of proposed system designs</li>
</ul>
